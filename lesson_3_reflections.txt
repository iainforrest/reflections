Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. All the time. 
i) It creates an online backup of your work in case something happens to your local machine. 
ii) It means that you can access the files from machines other than your own.
iii) when you have a project with multiple developers working on it. You have one centralised code depository.
