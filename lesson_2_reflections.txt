Commands Learnt:
git init - initialise a local git repository
git status - see the status of the repository plus any un tracked files.
git add "file" - move file to the git staging area. 
				- use to add files one at a time


Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. when you initialise the respository the .git directory is created. 
The reason we need to do this is to start the store of the git commit history.

Q.How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. A staging area is the limbo space between your working directory and 
the respoitory. The value of it is that we can add files to it as we work 
on them and then move all of them into the commit at the end. Also if we 
end up removing changes to a file before commiting we can remove the 
file from the staging area and not have unnesecary files in the commit.
